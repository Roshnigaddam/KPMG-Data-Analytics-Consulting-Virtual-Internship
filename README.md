# KPMG-Data-Analytics-Consulting-Virtual-Internship

The 3 datasets attached from Sprocket Central Pty Ltd. :

- Customer Demographic 
- Customer Addresses
- Transaction data in the past three months

TASK 1:
Assess the quality of their data as well as make recommendations on ways to clean the underlying data and mitigate these issues.
(Used Tableau Prep Builder for data cleaning, preperation and aggregation.)

TASK 2:
Sprocket Central Pty Ltd has given us a new list of 1000 potential customers with their demographics and attributes. However, these customers do not have prior transaction history with the organisation. 
The marketing team at Sprocket Central Pty Ltd is sure that, if correctly analysed, the data would reveal useful customer insights which could help optimise resource allocation for targeted marketing. Hence, improve performance by focusing on high value customers.
Using the existing 3 datasets (Customer demographic, customer address and transactions) as a labelled dataset, please recommend which of these 1000 new customers should be targeted to drive the most value for the organisation.

TASK 3:
Present your findings:
- What are the trends in the underlying data?
- Which customer segment has the highest customer value?
- What do you propose should be Sprocket Central Pty Ltd ’s marketing and growth strategy?
- What additional external datasets may be useful to obtain greater insights into customer preferences and propensity to purchase the products?
Specifically, your presentation should specify who Sprocket Central Pty Ltd’s marketing team should be targeting out of the new 1000 customer list as well as the broader market segment to reach out to. 
- Develop a dashboard that we can present to the client at our next meeting. Display your data summary and results of the analysis in a dashboard.
